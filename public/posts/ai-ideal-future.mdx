# What is the ideal outcome of AI for software development?

Right now, the software development space is filled with negative sentiment. Many bold enough to predict the future assume that AI will replace engineers, starting with those at the bottom. So, is that our only option? Does making engineers more productive mean we don't need as many? What are the different paths we can take, and why would we choose to take them?

## The Bad Path

Obviously, everyone's heard the rhetoric. We're *doomed*. As a Computer Science student, that's not what you want to hear, but that's the position I'm in. I don't really think this whole assumption that tech layoffs are a way for companies to replace workers with AI should be taken seriously.

We have to consider the state of the economy, global relations, and public sentiment over the last few years to adequately gauge how many of these layoffs are due to AI and how many are due to cost-cutting from companies in times of uncertainty. There is a third option, which is probably the most common, which is a mixture of both. Companies are starting to get more strapped for cash or less willing to spend due to economic uncertainty, and see AI as a free corner-cutter. It doesn't necessarily mean that companies see the code AI produces as equivalent to that of a human programmer, but they see it as good enough to not risk the money they could need soon.

So, companies are seeing AI as a way to maintain a similar output while spending less money. It's what we're currently seeing because of the quality of the models and tools that we have now. Companies are able to cut hiring because they don't need entry-level engineers when a senior-level engineer with the latest-and-greatest AI model can do that work in 1/10 of the time.

This path is unsustainable. Companies, at some point, will realize that to have senior-level engineers, we need entry-level engineers. The only way we stay this course is to progress enough so that AI programming is on-par with humans, which is unlikely, at least for a while.

I don't see this as an end-state. This is more of an in-between stage. The caveat I mentioned above is that we're restricted to current models, tools, and mindsets. As the industry adjusts for AI workflows, we should progress towards a better situation for programmers.

## The Good Path

There *is* another option. One where instead of maintaining current output, companies *expand*. Instead of cutting employees, they can delegate to one engineer what would've been assigned to entire teams. Engineers will need more, generalized knowledge, while the AI will be able to figure out the specifics. While the engineer could understand the core concepts, principles, and architectures of a system, the AI could have a deep knowledge of the libraries, APIs, and concepts needed to adjust it.

Throughout history, technological improvements have led to quality of life improvements, and this is how AI could do that. Personally, I think we’re currently in a transitional period similar to those we’ve seen in the past. I've seen tons of comparisons between AI improvements and innovations like the internet, while others calling them incomparable. Realistically, everyone probably believes "this time's different" at the time, but it'd be very surprising if history didn't repeat itself. AI is definitely a different beast though. We're "playing with fire", and we have about as much understanding of AI as we did of fire when we found it.

So, as a counterpoint to "The Bad Path", companies could instead spend the *same* amount of money and increase production by a huge margin. This could give companies incentive to experiment, expand, and compete in areas where it just wasn't worth it before. This ability to rapidly grow their reach could be a huge overall financial incentive for companies, thus thrusting them towards this, better option.

Obviously, senior-level engineers will always be more valuable, but entry-level engineers would be more productive, and thus more valuable than they are now.

This is going to require systematic changes to software development, which means it'll take time to transition. The thing is, this *does* lead to more problems.

## The Good Path Is Only For Engineers

Hopefully this section doesn't hurt my chances of working in big tech...

So, if you're a developer or engineer, that second option probably doesn't seem too bad. But if you dig a little deeper, you might see the problems in this.

Let's be honest, this route opens the door for the biggest companies to expand their presence. I think we can all agree that is not ideal. Big companies attract the best talent. The best talent produces the best products. This will only be emphasized by a world where each developer is working on their own thing within a company, thus having more direct influence on the products it offers. 

So, developers would have jobs, which is good, but they’d probably be the biggest group of beneficiaries.

## Or not…

Of course, we could also assume the opposite. This could also mean individuals and small companies could push out more code, faster, making it easier to compete with the larger companies.

If I’m top talent, why should I share the profits of a project with a big company over just doing it on my own and keeping it all myself? This is probably something engineers are going to have to contemplate in the future.

I’m sure companies will find ways to entice engineers, but that’s one more thing we can only speculate about.

## Conclusion

It’s difficult not to slip into tangent after tangent here. The implications are heavy and all we can really do is speculate. In contrast with the common sentiment in the industry, I’m hopeful for the future. 

We’re already seeing companies start to shift down “The Good Path”. In particular, Sundar Pichai recently stated on the [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oa_F0DcXKZU) that Google plans on increasing hiring over the next year. This, paired with their increasingly expanding web of products and services shows that they're uninterested in "The Bad Path". I urge you to listen to this clip. It pretty much encapsulates the possibilities of "The Good Path".

I’ve done my best not to be too pro- or anti- AI, but we’ve got to accept the reality. This is going to be world changing. If you’ve chosen to work in tech, you’re in the first group to meet this change. Hopefully, we’ll also be the first to adapt. After all, we wouldn’t have chosen tech if we weren’t interested in change.

The only advice I can give is to be ready to adjust your workflows, lifestyle, and skillset over the next few years. It’s going to be a wild ride.
