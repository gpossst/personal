# Clariphoto

I had always had this idea - Tinder for photos. You just swipe left on photos you want to delete and right on those you want to keep. It turns out, it had already been made. I made it anyways just for the sake of learning, and I learned a lot.

This was my first real self-inspired project, and I made the genius decision to do it in a language and framework that I had never worked with before. It was my first real experience teaching myself a new language and technology. 

Overall, it was a great experience for me to really jump in. I found the strength in learning as I went and developed strategies to quickly learn technologies. I also discovered a huge jump in learning rate by doing something I was inspired to do, albeit far over my head.

I let my Apple Developer License lapse, so all we've got left is the code.
