# National Parks Checklist

A checklist for those who want to visit every United States National Park. I made this because I was going on a road trip to three different parks and thought it would be cool to mark every place I went.

The biggest thing I got from this project is the availability of free data on the internet. I was able to get so much information directly from open sources like Wikipedia. 

This also gave me experience really diving into PostgreSQL. Prior to this, I had dabbled, even had some school assignment with SQL, but here I was actually in the weeds.
