# Reformify

My first time really using Next.js. Prior to this, I had basically used Next as a router and for boilerplate. Here, I would go all out.

I made this as a way to simplify forms. The goal was to avoid having to spin up a database, save users from spam, and let them build with ease. It's pretty much just Next.js APIs that use API tokens to verify users, then insert any form submssions into a database. It's then got a rather ugly (sorry) UI that lets users view any submssions they've had. 

I learned a lot about APIs during this process, the OpenAPI spec is a big thing. I might revisit it at some point, but things have been too busy lately.
