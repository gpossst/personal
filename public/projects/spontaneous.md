# Spontaneous

My goal here was to create a directory of one-day lift ticket prices for different resorts. I noticed a trend where if you bought tickets the day before going, they were cheaper than buying regularly, so I built a tool I thought would be useful for myself and others.

This project taught me a ton about web scraping. I learned to find patterns in network history and site visualizations in order to get the data as efficiently and easily as possible.

## Problems

It turns out, not everyone wants you sniffing on their website. I had to find some nifty little workarounds in order to actually get any data from Veil affiliated ski resorts. It was my first real introduction to anti-scraping methods.
