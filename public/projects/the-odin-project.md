# The Odin Project

Where it all started. After starting and stopping a number of times through the Covid-19 lockdown, The Odin Project was the first program that I stuck to. I on-and-off worked on The Odin Project's coursework over the course of about a year.

I wish I had been more enthused initially, but I didn't truly get the excitement to code until later on. The beginning steps, when you're just re-dredging things everyone has done, was the biggest reason I was so slow in learning over that period.
