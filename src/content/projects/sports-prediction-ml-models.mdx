# Sports Prediction AI Models

I was tired of web development and had my interest sparked by [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkJpNLIaeVk) video. I decided to learn the basics of neural networks, then jump in with an algorithm that would take NBA team statistics and predict a team's win percentage. I've since begun working on a model for the MLB as well, going so far as to use the MLB's unofficial, official stats API to get a night's schedule, get each team's stats, and predict the outcome for every game.

I learned a ton about neural networks, data manipulation, data normalization, and data availability. I realized that despite having a ton of fun with web development, there's a lot of programming that I've neglected to explore.

## Problems

For a sport as stat-intensive as baseball, I found it difficult to find comprehensive historical box scores for games. I was forced to sort through Reddit threads and documentation to finally land on a Kaggle dataset that had what I needed.
